# grid_interface
node based grid interface with comms to arduino // raspi and termux 

Nodeserver on server.js that is just static server.

first grid interface on ctrl_gsap.html 
second interface for testing motor control is ctrl_test.html

atm this runs on pi, later this will probably run on android tablet

comm from node to robot (arduino) will be either serial to arduino then RF/BT, 
or direct through Bluetooth if this works from pi or android tablet through chrome browser or node
